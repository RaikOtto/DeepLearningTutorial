## The MNIST dataset is included with Keras and can be accessed using the dataset_mnist() function. Here we load the dataset then create variables for our test and training data:

library(keras)
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

## The x data is a 3-d array (images,width,height) of grayscale values . To prepare the data for training we convert the 3-d arrays into matrices by reshaping width and height into a single dimension (28x28 images are flattened into length 784 vectors). Then, we convert the grayscale values from integers ranging between 0 to 255 into floating point values ranging between 0 and 1:

# reshape
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 784))
x_test <- array_reshape(x_test, c(nrow(x_test), 784))
# rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

## Note that we use the array_reshape() function rather than the dim<-() function to reshape the array. This is so that the data is re-interpreted using row-major semantics (as opposed to Râ€™s default column-major semantics), which is in turn compatible with the way that the numerical libraries called by Keras interpret array dimensions.
## The y data is an integer vector with values ranging from 0 to 9. To prepare this data for training we one-hot encode the vectors into binary class matrices using the Keras to_categorical() function:

y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)

## Defining the Model
## The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers.
## We begin by creating a sequential model and then adding layers using the pipe (%>%) operator:

model <- keras_model_sequential() 
model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

## The input_shape argument to the first layer specifies the shape of the input data (a length 784 numeric vector representing a grayscale image). The final layer outputs a length 10 numeric vector (probabilities for each digit) using a softmax activation function.
## Use the summary() function to print the details of the model:

summary(model)

## Next, compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics:

model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)

## Training and Evaluation
## Use the fit() function to train the model for 30 epochs using batches of 128 images:

history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)

## The history object returned by fit() includes loss and accuracy metrics which we can plot:

plot(history)

model %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test)

## Generate predictions on new data:

model %>% predict_classes(x_test)
